## Overview
The AQMS is a cutting-edge solution designed to address the increasing need for effective air quality monitoring in urban and industrial environments. Inspired by the latest advancements in Industry 4.0, our system integrates:

1. Real-Time Monitoring: Collects live air quality data from IoT sensors.
2. Predictive Analytics: Uses machine learning to forecast trends and identify anomalies.
3. Interactive Visualization: Offers 3D views of air quality metrics for intuitive understanding.

This platform is open-source, scalable, and modular, making it adaptable to various use cases, including urban planning, industrial compliance, and public health monitoring.
